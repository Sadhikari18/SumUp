Program written in JAVA to run the generate test

Instruction to run the test

JAVA 1.8 or up is needed
Some kind of editor is needed if want to run the test using right click(preferred is intellij idea)
maven installation is needed

I tried to containerized in docker but due to time constrained I feel like it will take more time(I tried to run the container but some issue came)


1) This test can be run using the testing.xml file or by "mvn test"(provided maven is installed) or by right clicking the class/method and running the test

2)with maven installed run the command --> "mvn test" in the root folder
